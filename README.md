# localclaude

Run **Claude Code** against a **local Qwen** model on Apple Silicon, with real web research. One-script install. No cloud, no API keys, no rate limits.

**The main repo for the Apple-Silicon Claude Code stack.** Carries the `localclaude` lifecycle wrapper, the install script, and the architecture docs. The install script clones the sister components (vllm-mlx fork, searxng-mcp) as siblings.

**Read also**: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) · [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) · [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) (if you're an AI agent installing or modifying this stack).

## What gets installed

> **⚠ Important about vllm-mlx**: this stack installs from the **`akaszubski/vllm-mlx` fork**, not upstream `waybarrios/vllm-mlx` or `pip install vllm-mlx` from PyPI. The fork carries the prompt optimizer, tool-stubbing, and thinking-gate patches that turn ~50s prefill into ~3-5s on an 80K-token Claude Code request. Without these patches the local stack is barely usable. Bug reports go to upstream (`waybarrios/vllm-mlx`); installs come from the fork. See the "vllm-mlx fork patches" section below for details.

| Component | Repo | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **`localclaude/`** (this repo) | [`akaszubski/localclaude`](https://github.com/akaszubski/localclaude) | Lifecycle wrapper. Boots `vllm-mlx` with the right model + tool parser per profile, prints the `claude` connect command, manages stop/restart/status. Auto-starts the SearXNG container. |
| **`vllm-mlx/`** (sibling — cloned by `install.sh`) | [`akaszubski/vllm-mlx`](https://github.com/akaszubski/vllm-mlx) | The inference server. **Required fork** — vLLM-style continuous batching + paged KV cache + prefix cache + SSD tiering on Metal. The patches that make local Claude fast live here. |
| **`searxng-mcp/`** (sibling — cloned by `install.sh`) | [`akaszubski/searxng-mcp`](https://github.com/akaszubski/searxng-mcp) | Tiny MCP server giving Claude Code a `mcp__searxng__*` web-search tool backed by a local SearXNG container. Replaces Anthropic's server-side `WebSearch`. |

## First-time setup

### Recommended: one script does it all

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akaszubski/localclaude.git ~/Dev/localclaude
cd ~/Dev/localclaude
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` will clone the sister repos (`vllm-mlx`, `searxng-mcp`) as siblings of `localclaude`, so you'll end up with:

```
~/Dev/
|-- localclaude/      <- the main repo (you cloned this)
|-- vllm-mlx/         <- the fork (cloned by install.sh)
`-- searxng-mcp/      <- the MCP server (cloned by install.sh)
```

`install.sh` is **Mac-only** and idempotent — safe to re-run. It walks through 8 phases:

1. Pre-flight: verifies macOS + Apple Silicon + RAM.
2. System deps: checks/installs `git`, `python3`, `claude` CLI, OrbStack via Homebrew. (You need Homebrew already — `https://brew.sh`.)
3. Clones sister repos (`vllm-mlx` fork, `searxng-mcp`) as siblings of this `localclaude` repo.
4. Python deps: `pip install -e ./vllm-mlx`, plus a dedicated `searxng-mcp/.venv` with `mcp` + `httpx`.
5. Starts the OrbStack engine and brings up the `localclaude-searxng` container.
6. Registers `searxng` MCP server with Claude Code (`claude mcp add`).
7. Appends a `PATH` line to your shell rc so `localclaude` is callable from anywhere (prompts before editing).
8. Runs `localclaude doctor` to verify everything's healthy.

Flags: `--yes` (auto-confirm prompts), `--no-path` (skip shell rc edit), `--no-mcp` (skip MCP registration), `--dry-run` (show what would happen, change nothing). `./install.sh --help` for details.

### Manual setup (if you'd rather)

If you want to step through it yourself or you're on a non-standard layout:

<details>
<summary>Show manual steps</summary>

#### Hardware / OS prereqs

- Apple Silicon Mac (M1+). Recommended ≥32 GB RAM for `coder` profile, ≥64 GB for `coder-next` 8-bit, ≥256 GB for `coder-480`.
- macOS 14+.

#### Clone the repos

```bash
cd ~/Dev   # or any parent dir of your choice
git clone https://github.com/akaszubski/localclaude.git
# vllm-mlx: clone the FORK, not upstream -- see warning above
git clone https://github.com/akaszubski/vllm-mlx.git
git clone https://github.com/akaszubski/searxng-mcp.git
```

After this, `localclaude` auto-resolves all sister paths from its own location -- no env vars needed unless you've moved things.

#### Install dependencies

```bash
# Inference server — use the local checkout (carries optimizer + thinking-gate
# patches that ship before they reach PyPI). On macOS Python 3.12+ pip will
# refuse the system install (PEP 668); add --break-system-packages or use a
# venv if so. install.sh handles this automatically.
cd vllm-mlx && pip install -e . && cd ..
# (or if PEP 668 blocks):
# cd vllm-mlx && pip install -e . --break-system-packages && cd ..

# Claude Code CLI + OrbStack:
brew install --cask claude-code     # NOTE: `brew install claude` installs the
                                    # macOS DESKTOP APP, not the CLI. Use --cask claude-code.
brew install --cask orbstack
orb start
```

#### Bring up SearXNG (web search backend)

```bash
cd searxng-mcp && docker compose up -d
curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:8080/ >/dev/null && echo "SearXNG up"
```

Container is named `localclaude-searxng` with `restart: unless-stopped`, so it auto-comes-back after reboots once OrbStack is running.

#### Register the MCP server with Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add searxng -- $(pwd)/run.sh   # from inside searxng-mcp/
```

#### Put `localclaude` on your PATH

```bash
cd localclaude/
echo 'export PATH="'"$(pwd)"':$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

</details>

## Model storage

**This stack uses `~/Models/` as the canonical HuggingFace cache** (not the upstream `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/` default). Set in your shell rc:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Models
echo 'export HF_HUB_CACHE="$HOME/Models"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

After this, every `huggingface-cli download` and every implicit `from_pretrained()` writes to `~/Models/`. `localclaude` natively recognises this location via `_is_model_cached()` ([localclaude:342](https://github.com/akaszubski/localclaude/blob/main/localclaude#L342)) which checks `$HOME/Models` first and falls back to the upstream default for legacy installs.

### Why not `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/`?

- `.cache/` is treated as evictable by macOS Storage management and third-party "free up disk" utilities — your 17–250 GB models can vanish silently.
- A dedicated `~/Models/` is easier to back up, exclude from Time Machine, symlink to an external SSD, or **NFS-mount across machines** (see below).
- Clean separation: intentional model weights vs transient tool caches.

### Pre-download (skip the first-start wait)

By default, `localclaude start <profile>` lazy-downloads weights on first use — that can be a 30 min wait on a 17 GB model, hours on the 480B. Pre-download instead:

```bash
# Pip-install the HF CLI if you don't have it:
brew install huggingface-cli      # preferred on macOS (avoids PEP 668)
# Or via pip if you prefer: pip install --user huggingface_hub[cli]
# (or: pip install --break-system-packages huggingface_hub[cli] on Python 3.12+)

# Download a specific profile's weights (uses HF_HUB_CACHE → goes to ~/Models):
huggingface-cli download mlx-community/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-4bit

# Or temporarily route to an external SSD:
HF_HUB_CACHE=/Volumes/MyExternalSSD/Models \
  huggingface-cli download mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-8bit
```

### What's already cached?

```bash
localclaude list      # shows MLX models cached under ~/Models or ~/.cache/huggingface/hub
```

### Migrating from `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/`

Already have models cached at the upstream default? Move them to `~/Models/`:

```bash
# Move (no copy — instant):
mv ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--* ~/Models/

# Verify:
localclaude list
```

`localclaude` reads from both paths so nothing breaks during the migration.

### Disk hygiene

Weights are content-addressed by SHA, so re-downloading is cheap (it just re-verifies). To reclaim disk, delete entire `models--<repo>--<name>/` directories under `~/Models/`. Don't try to selectively delete shards — `huggingface_hub` will re-fetch the missing ones on next load.

## (Optional) Multi-Mac setups

**Skip this section if you're running on a single Mac** — that's the default and everything below is opt-in. The stack works without any of it.

The two reasons you'd want multi-Mac:

1. **You have an M3 Ultra (or similar) with the RAM to run `coder-480` (~250 GB)** but you mostly work from a different Mac. Set `LOCALCLAUDE_CODER_480_REMOTE=user@m3-host` in your client Mac's shell rc; `localclaude start coder-480` from there will SSH-route to the M3 transparently.

2. **You want to share model downloads across Macs** to avoid duplicating 17–250 GB per machine. NFS-mount `~/Models/` from one Mac onto the others.

### Single-Mac users: no action needed

- `LOCALCLAUDE_CODER_480_REMOTE` is unset → `coder-480` won't try to SSH anywhere. (It also won't fit on most Macs — only `coder` / `instruct` / `qwen36` / `gemma4` work on machines with <256 GB RAM.)
- `~/Models/` is just a regular local directory.
- You can ignore everything in this section.

### NFS-share `~/Models` across machines

```
M3 Ultra (server)                  M4 Max (client)
└─ /Users/<m3user>/Models/         └─ /Users/<m4user>/Models/   ← NFS mount of M3's path
       (real filesystem)                  (mountpoint)
```

Both machines export `HF_HUB_CACHE=$HOME/Models`. `huggingface-cli download` on either Mac writes to the shared store. `localclaude start coder` on either Mac finds the cached weights immediately — no per-Mac re-download.

Setup on the NFS *server* Mac (M3 Ultra in this example):

```bash
# /etc/exports — export ~/Models read/write to the trusted Mac
echo "/Users/$(whoami)/Models -rw -mapall=$(whoami) -network 10.55.0.0 -mask 255.255.255.0" | sudo tee -a /etc/exports
sudo nfsd update
```

Setup on the NFS *client* Mac (M4 in this example):

```bash
# autofs map (survives reboots; lazy-mounts on access)
echo "/Users/$(whoami)/Models  -fstype=nfs,nodev,nosuid,noatime  10.55.0.2:/Users/<m3user>/Models" | sudo tee -a /etc/auto_master_local
sudo automount -cv

ls ~/Models | head    # should show the M3-side files
```

Replace `10.55.0.2` with your M3's mesh IP (Tailscale, Tailnet, or LAN). Replace `<m3user>` with the M3's username.

### Multi-Mac compatibility checklist

What's shared vs what's per-machine when you run this stack on more than one Mac:

| Component | Per-machine | Shareable | Notes |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| Model weights (`~/Models/`) | | ✅ NFS | Same SHA-content; `localclaude` resolves identically. |
| `vllm-mlx` Python install | ✅ | | Per-machine pip editable install (deps differ per Python). Run `./install.sh` on each Mac. |
| `searxng-mcp` container | ✅ | | Each Mac needs its own `localclaude-searxng` container on `:8080`. |
| `searxng-mcp/.venv` | ✅ | | Per-machine Python venv. |
| `localclaude` script | | ✅ | Cloneable per-machine, OR symlink from NFS (`ln -s /Users/<m3user>/Dev/localclaude/localclaude /usr/local/bin/localclaude`). The script uses `$HOME` consistently — same code works for any user. |
| `~/.localclaude/.active`, `~/.localclaude/logs/` | ✅ | | Per-machine state — don't share. |
| `~/.localclaude/ssd-cache/` | ✅ | | Per-machine SSD KV cache. Sharing via NFS would defeat the latency point. |
| `LOCALCLAUDE_*` env vars (in `~/.zshrc`) | ✅ | | Set per machine. `LOCALCLAUDE_CODER_480_REMOTE` typically only set on the *client* Macs (the M3 itself doesn't need to SSH to itself). |

Practical install order for a second Mac (assuming first Mac already set up):

```bash
# 1. Mount the existing ~/Models via NFS (see "Multi-Mac setup" above).
# 2. Clone + install on the new Mac:
git clone https://github.com/akaszubski/localclaude.git ~/Dev/localclaude
cd ~/Dev/localclaude
./install.sh
# 3. Set HF_HUB_CACHE in this Mac's ~/.zshrc:
echo 'export HF_HUB_CACHE="$HOME/Models"' >> ~/.zshrc
# 4. (Optional, for client Macs) point coder-480 at the model server:
echo 'export LOCALCLAUDE_CODER_480_REMOTE=user@m3-ip-or-host' >> ~/.zshrc
```

`./install.sh` will detect that `~/Models/` is already populated (via NFS) and skip the model-download wait entirely on the second Mac.

| Profile | HF model | On-disk | Loaded RAM | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| `coder` | `mlx-community/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-4bit` | ~17 GB | ~17 GB | Daily driver. |
| `coder-next` | `lmstudio-community/Qwen3-Coder-Next-MLX-8bit` | ~32 GB | ~32 GB | Top SWE-bench Pass@5; needs ≥64 GB RAM. |
| `coder-480` | `mlx-community/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-4bit` | ~250 GB | ~250 GB | Auto-routes via SSH if local Mac doesn't have weights cached (set `LOCALCLAUDE_CODER_480_REMOTE=user@host`). |
| `instruct` | `mlx-community/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-4bit` | ~17 GB | ~17 GB | General-purpose MoE baseline. |
| `qwen36` | `mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-8bit` | ~35 GB | ~35 GB | Newest 35B-A3B MoE; agentic-coding tuned. |
| `gemma4` | `mlx-community/gemma-4-31b-it-4bit` | ~18 GB | ~18 GB | ⚠ Currently broken under continuous batching ([vllm-mlx#380](https://github.com/waybarrios/vllm-mlx/issues/380)). |

Sizes are approximate (based on the safetensors shards on HuggingFace). Loaded-RAM is roughly the file size for 4-bit quants, slightly more for 8-bit.

### Pre-download (skip the first-start wait)

By default, `localclaude start <profile>` lazy-downloads weights on first use — that can be a 30 min wait on a 17 GB model, or hours on the 480B. Pre-download instead:

```bash
# Pip-install the HF CLI if you don't have it:
brew install huggingface-cli      # preferred on macOS (avoids PEP 668)
# Or via pip if you prefer: pip install --user huggingface_hub[cli]
# (or: pip install --break-system-packages huggingface_hub[cli] on Python 3.12+)

# Download a specific profile's weights:
huggingface-cli download mlx-community/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-4bit

# Or use a custom cache:
HF_HOME=/Volumes/MyExternalSSD/hf huggingface-cli download mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-8bit
```

### What's already cached?

```bash
localclaude list      # shows MLX models cached on this Mac
```

### Disk hygiene

Weights are content-addressed by SHA, so re-downloading is cheap (just re-verifies). To reclaim disk, delete entire `models--<repo>--<name>/` directories under `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/`. Don't try to selectively delete shards — `huggingface_hub` will re-fetch the missing ones on next load.

### Profiles

| Key | Model | Tool parser | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `coder` | `mlx-community/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-4bit` | `qwen3_coder` | MoE A3B coder, ~120 tok/s on M4 Max |
| `coder-next` | `lmstudio-community/Qwen3-Coder-Next-MLX-8bit` | `qwen3_coder` | 8-bit, top SWE-bench Pass@5 |
| `coder-480` | `mlx-community/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-4bit` | `qwen3_coder` | ~250 GB on disk; auto-routes via SSH if `LOCALCLAUDE_CODER_480_REMOTE` is set; bails clearly otherwise |
| `instruct` | `mlx-community/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-4bit` | `qwen` | General MoE baseline. ⚠ See [vllm-mlx#431](https://github.com/waybarrios/vllm-mlx/issues/431) -- `qwen` parser drops whitespace-only deltas mid-stream; markdown layout collapses (cosmetic). |
| `qwen36` | `mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-8bit` | `qwen` | Newest 35B-A3B MoE, agentic-coding tuned (download on demand). Same `qwen`-parser caveat as `instruct`. |
| `gemma4` | `mlx-community/gemma-4-31b-it-4bit` | `gemma4` | ⚠ **Currently broken** -- see [vllm-mlx#380](https://github.com/waybarrios/vllm-mlx/issues/380): nonsense output under continuous batching. Use `qwen36` instead until upstream fix lands. |

Pass arbitrary models via `localclaude start -model <hf-id>`.

### Allowlist presets

`-allowlist <preset>` controls the **vllm-mlx prompt optimizer**'s tool allowlist (see [vllm-mlx fork patches](#vllm-mlx-fork-patches-the-reason-this-is-fast) below). The optimizer drops tool definitions whose names aren't on the list and replaces verbose descriptions with short stubs. **This is the single biggest perf win for local Claude** -- without it, prefill of an 80K-token Claude Code request takes ~50s on M4 Max instead of ~3-5s.

| Preset | Tools sent | Token reduction | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `minimal` | 6 (Read, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, Write) | ~99.5% | File ops + shell only. Fastest prefill. |
| `code` (default) | 33 Claude Code natives + `mcp__searxng__*` | ~98% | Full agentic toolkit + local web research. WebSearch / WebFetch dropped (no-ops vs local server) so the model uses MCP instead. Other MCP servers (Gmail, Calendar, etc.) excluded. |
| `web` | (alias for `code`) | | Backwards compat. |
| `all` / `off` / `none` | Full 274+ tool catalog | 0% | Slowest first prefill (~50s for 80k tokens). Every registered MCP tool included. Use only when you specifically need a tool the `code` allowlist filters out. |

## Daily flow

```bash
# Terminal 1 — server (cd to whatever project you want claude to work in)
cd ~/Dev/myproject
localclaude start coder
# Boots vllm-mlx, ensures SearXNG container is up (auto-starts OrbStack
# engine + container if either is down), prints the claude connect command.

# Terminal 2 — Claude Code
localclaude cc
# Or paste the env-var command that `start` printed.
```

When done:

```bash
localclaude stop          # kills server, prefix cache lost
# Or just leave it running — keeps the prefix cache warm.
```

## Benchmarks

> ### ⚠ Methodology and data quality caveats
>
> Numbers below come from two sources:
> 1. **vllm-mlx upstream benchmark suite** — controlled, reproducible, multi-trial. Reasonably trustworthy.
> 2. **Captured Claude Code session logs** (this stack, in normal use) — single observations under unknown concurrent load. **Treat as anecdotal**, not as paired A/B benchmarks. Conditions varied: some were on M3 Ultra running other workloads concurrently, some were measured during the early `coder-480` configuration before tuning settled.
>
> Anything in the "session-log captures" tables is marked with `(n=1)` or `(n=few, single session)`. The `coder-480` decode number especially is preliminary and likely lower than the model's true ceiling on a quiet M3 Ultra — it has not yet been re-benched on idle hardware.
>
> Re-running the harness with `bench/run.sh --conditions A,B,C,D,E --trials 5` on the target hardware will produce trustable numbers. We haven't done a clean cross-hardware pass yet.

### Decode tokens/sec (vllm-mlx upstream benchmark suite)

These come from `vllm-mlx/docs/benchmarks/llm.md` — multi-trial, controlled. Trustworthy.

| Model | Quant | Hardware | Decode tok/s | TTFT (warm) |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 (`instruct`) | 4-bit | M4 Max 128 GB | 123.9 | 127 ms |
| Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct (reference) | 4-bit | M4 Max | 200.1 | 81 ms |
| Qwen3-0.6B (reference) | 8-bit | M4 Max | 402.3 | 59 ms |
| Qwen3-0.6B (reference) | 8-bit | M1 Max | 251.9 | 119 ms |
| Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B (reference) | 6-bit | M4 Max | 122.9 | 72 ms |

### Decode tokens/sec (this stack — session log captures, anecdotal)

| Model | Quant | Hardware | Decode tok/s | n | Notes |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct (`coder`) | 4-bit | M4 Max 128 GB | ~107–120 | few | Daily-driver observations; consistent across small/medium prompts |
| Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B (`coder-480`) | 4-bit | M3 Ultra 512 GB | ~16–17 ❓ | 1 | **Preliminary — likely understated**. Single observation under unknown concurrent load. The user has flagged this as suspect; needs re-bench on idle M3 Ultra |

### TTFT under real Claude Code traffic (session log captures, n=1)

These are individual log captures, not paired-trial measurements. Useful for "what does cold vs warm cache look like in practice" but don't quote them as benchmarks.

| Model | Hardware | Prompt size | Cache state | TTFT (n=1) |
|---|---|---:|---|---:|
| Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-4bit | M4 Max | ~33 tok | warm | 70–400 ms |
| Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-4bit | M4 Max | 19,113 / 19,091 cached | prefix-cache HIT | 3.2 s |
| Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-4bit | M4 Max | 4,694 new / 5K cached | partial hit | 5.2 s |
| Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-4bit | M4 Max | ~22K | cold (new project) | 30 s |
| Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-4bit | M3 Ultra | 19,004 tok | cold | 95.8 s |
| Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-4bit | M3 Ultra | 22,469 / 2,508 cached | project-switch (mostly miss) | 117.4 s |

The directional pattern is real: prefix-cache hits give an order-of-magnitude TTFT reduction on the 30B model, and the cold-prefill penalty grows steeply with model size. The exact numbers are single-observation and conditions varied.

### Continuous batching wins (vllm-mlx upstream benchmark suite, M4 Max)

Multi-trial, controlled. Trustworthy.

| Model | Single stream | 5-stream batch | Speedup |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen3-30B-A3B-4bit | 98.1 tok/s | 233.3 tok/s | 2.38× |
| Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit | 299.1 | 613.0 | 2.05× |
| Qwen3-0.6B-8bit | 328.1 | 1111.8 | 3.39× |

Paged cache adds another ~1.1× on top of batching (681 → 766 tok/s, 20-req test).

### Optimizer ON vs OFF (design target, NOT measured as paired A/B)

| Configuration | Tools sent | First-turn prefill |
|---|---:|---:|
| Default `code` allowlist (33 tools, stubs on) | 33 | ~3 s (claim) |
| All MCP tools, no allowlist | ~277 | ~50 s (claim, for ~80K tokens) |

**Caveat**: design target derived from token-count math + log observations on Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-4bit. **Not** a controlled paired-trial measurement. The closest direct measurement is the 30 s cold prefill at 22 K tokens in the table above. The 50 s vs 3 s framing should be treated as "what we expect to see when we actually run the A/B" — not a measured result.

### Cache configuration A/B (`bench/run.sh`, preliminary — small n)

From `bench/runs/20260426-151203/` and `20260426-213941/`. Wall-clock for `claude --print` round-trips. Trial counts 1-5 per cell. **Directional only — not enough trials to claim winners definitively.**

| Cond | Case | first-call wall (ms) | repeat wall (ms) |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| A (baseline) | 02_cc_list_files | 10,579–44,592 | 26,355 |
| B (+`--warm-prompts`) | 02_cc_list_files | 11,133–25,160 | 11,184 |
| C (+`--ssd-cache-dir`) | 02_cc_list_files | 46,767 | 27,699 |
| D (+`--kv-cache-quantization`) | 02_cc_list_files | 30,424–46,817 | 27,919 |
| C (+`--ssd-cache-dir`) | 03_cc_explain_readme | 26,025 | 7,906 |

The cleanest directional signals: `--warm-prompts` repeat-wall ~2.4× faster than baseline on case 02; `--ssd-cache-dir` ~3× faster than baseline on case 03 repeat. Both are single trials per cell and need re-running with `--trials 5+` before being load-bearing.

### What we have NOT measured (be honest)

- **No controlled optimizer-on vs optimizer-off A/B** in the bench harness. The 50 s vs 3 s claim is a design target, not a paired-trial measurement.
- **No per-quantization sweep** on the same model (e.g. 4-bit vs 8-bit Qwen3-Coder-30B on identical hardware).
- **No wired-memory / RSS time series** for the leak in [`vllm-mlx#442`](https://github.com/waybarrios/vllm-mlx/issues/442). Only point-in-time KV-cache MB readings from scheduler logs.
- **No MTP (`--enable-mtp`) numbers** on `coder-next` / `qwen36` profiles. Bench condition E is wired but the run hasn't been done yet.
- **No clean re-bench of `coder-480` on idle M3 Ultra.** The current 16-17 tok/s number is suspect (single observation under unknown concurrent load).
- **No paired comparison across hardware** for the same model + same workload (would isolate hardware contribution).

If you re-run the bench, results land in `bench/runs/<timestamp>/summary.md` and can be folded back into this section.

## Recommended `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` snippet (nice-to-have)

**Strictly required?** No — localclaude's default `code` allowlist physically removes `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` from the tool list, so the model can't call them. Removed tools mean the model goes straight to `mcp__searxng__*` for web research.

**Why add it anyway**: with explicit guidance in your global CLAUDE.md, the model picks `mcp__searxng__*` confidently on the first turn instead of inferring it from "the WebSearch tool seems to be missing." It also helps when you switch between local Claude (this stack) and cloud Claude (where WebSearch *does* exist) — the same guidance still routes correctly: WebSearch when available, MCP when not.

Append to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Tool selection — when to search the web vs the repo

When the user asks for any of the following, prefer **`mcp__searxng__search`** (and `mcp__searxng__fetch` for full page content):

- "research X", "look up X", "find online", "search the web", "search the internet"
- Any question about **current versions**, **recent releases**, **latest docs**, **public APIs**, or **external benchmarks**
- Any question that names a **GitHub repo, a vendor product, or a cloud service** that isn't in the current working directory
- Any "what's new with X" / "is there a newer Y" question
- Any question whose factual answer would not exist on this machine

When the user asks for any of the following, prefer **`Glob`/`Read`/`Grep`/`Bash`**:

- "explain this repo", "where is X defined", "find all callers of Y"
- Any request whose answer is in the current working directory or a file the user has mentioned

When in doubt and the request is ambiguous, ask once which scope they want — local repo or web.

The `mcp__searxng__*` tools route to a local SearXNG container, so search is private and free; prefer them over `WebSearch`/`WebFetch` (which are no-ops when running against a local LLM server).
```

This is ~15 lines / ~700 chars. Counts toward the global CLAUDE.md token budget (see "Keep your CLAUDE.md files lean" below) but the perf cost is small for the routing benefit.

## Keep your CLAUDE.md files lean

Claude Code embeds two CLAUDE.md files in **every** request's system prompt:
- **Global**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — sent on every request from every project.
- **Project**: `./CLAUDE.md` (per repo) — sent on every request from that project.

Both are inside the cacheable prefix that vllm-mlx's prefix cache hashes. **Each token you add costs you twice**:

1. **Prefill cost**: every fresh request pays for those tokens at prefill speed (slow for cold starts).
2. **Cache invalidation across projects**: switching projects means a different `./CLAUDE.md` content → different prefix → cache miss → ~95–117s cold prefill on Qwen3-Coder-480B in our testing. The bigger your CLAUDE.mds, the more tokens cache-miss when you switch.

Practical guidance from our profiling:

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| Keep global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` under ~2 KB. Personal preferences only. | Dump every workflow rule, framework, philosophy doc in there. It's sent with every request, everywhere. |
| Keep project `./CLAUDE.md` under ~3 KB. Truly project-specific facts only (build command, test runner, deploy quirks). | Mirror your README into CLAUDE.md. Claude can `Read` files on demand. |
| Use sub-docs (`docs/*.md`) for deep reference and let Claude pull them when needed. | Keep "future plans" or "TODO" sections in CLAUDE.md. They invalidate the cache and aren't actionable. |
| Audit periodically: `wc -c ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md`. | Forget global CLAUDE.md exists. It's the easiest one to bloat. |

If you want a precise breakdown of where your prefix tokens are going, the upstream issue [`autonomous-dev#979`](https://github.com/akaszubski/autonomous-dev/issues/979) tracks an `audit-context` command for this.

Note also that **MCP server tool definitions dwarf CLAUDE.md** in most setups — the optimizer's tool allowlist (above) is the bigger lever. CLAUDE.md hygiene is the second-biggest.

## ⚠ Operational caveats (read before exposing this beyond loopback)

`localclaude` defaults to binding `127.0.0.1` for a reason. Surfaced from open upstream issues:

| Issue | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| [`waybarrios/vllm-mlx#68`](https://github.com/waybarrios/vllm-mlx/issues/68) | `vllm-mlx` ships with no auth, vanilla `serve` defaults to `0.0.0.0`, and `/v1/messages` is open. ~25 vulns documented including SSRF in multimodal URL fetch and `trust_remote_code=True` defaults. | Keep `localclaude start` on its default `127.0.0.1` bind unless you understand the implications. If you need LAN access (e.g. M3 Ultra remote profile), pass `-bind <mesh-ip>` only on a trusted network and consider also setting `--api-key` via `LOCALCLAUDE_EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS`. **Do not expose to the public internet.** |
| [`waybarrios/vllm-mlx#442`](https://github.com/waybarrios/vllm-mlx/issues/442) | **MLX wired/Metal memory grows unbounded under sustained traffic.** Python RSS underreports — `ps`/Activity Monitor won't catch it. Eventually `kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorOutOfMemory`. | Restart the server periodically on long-running sessions (`localclaude restart`). Watch *wired memory* (`memory_pressure`, `vm_stat`), not RSS. Symptom: gradually-rising responses, then a hard kill. |
| [`waybarrios/vllm-mlx#380`](https://github.com/waybarrios/vllm-mlx/issues/380) | **Gemma 4 profile is currently broken** — multiple parser/template bugs cause nonsense output under continuous batching, plus stray `&lt;channel&#124;&gt;` tokens from the reasoning parser. | Don't use the `gemma4` profile until upstream fix lands. Stick with `coder` / `coder-next` / `qwen36`. |
| [`waybarrios/vllm-mlx#431`](https://github.com/waybarrios/vllm-mlx/issues/431) | Streaming whitespace-only deltas dropped under the generic `qwen` and `minimax` tool parsers — markdown layout collapses mid-stream. The `qwen3_coder` parser is unaffected. | Affects `instruct` / `qwen36` profiles (which use `--tool-call-parser qwen`). Either accept the cosmetic glitch or wait for the imminent upstream fix. `coder` and `coder-next` use `qwen3_coder` and are unaffected. |
| [`waybarrios/vllm-mlx#422`](https://github.com/waybarrios/vllm-mlx/issues/422) | MoE MTP load fails (`dequantize` triggered on bare-key tensors) — affects MTP weights generated for Qwen3.5/3.6 MoE targets via `add_mtp_weights_qwen35.py`. | If you generate MTP weights for `coder-next` / `qwen36`, apply the one-line patch from the issue thread or pin generation away from MoE targets until merged. |

These are all upstream `waybarrios/vllm-mlx` issues; track them there for fix progress.

## vllm-mlx fork patches (the reason this is fast)

> **TL;DR**: the [`akaszubski/vllm-mlx`](https://github.com/akaszubski/vllm-mlx) fork is **mandatory** for usable local Claude performance. It's not optional, not "nice to have", not "for advanced users". Without it (running upstream `waybarrios/vllm-mlx` or PyPI `pip install vllm-mlx`), prefill of an 80K-token Claude Code request takes ~50s instead of ~3-5s. The install script clones the fork; don't override.

The fork ([`akaszubski/vllm-mlx`](https://github.com/akaszubski/vllm-mlx), branched off [`waybarrios/vllm-mlx`](https://github.com/waybarrios/vllm-mlx)) carries five patches that aren't upstream yet — they're the difference between *barely usable* and *fast* local Claude:

| Patch | Commit | Flag(s) | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Anthropic /v1/messages prompt optimizer** | `818f3fcb` | `--optimize-prompts` | Master switch for all the optimizer transforms below. Off by default upstream; `localclaude` enables it. |
| **Tool allowlist** | `818f3fcb` | `--optimize-tool-allowlist <csv>` | Drops tool definitions whose names aren't on the list. Claude Code 2.x ships with 274+ tools (MCP servers + native); without an allowlist, every request carries ~100K tokens of tool schemas. The default `code` allowlist sends 33. |
| **Tool description stubs** | `818f3fcb` | `--optimize-stub-tools` | Replaces verbose tool descriptions and JSON schemas with short stubs. Combined with the allowlist, ships ~3.5K chars vs ~195K — **~98% prefill reduction**. |
| **Auto-disable thinking on tool calls** | `b680dc20` | (automatic) | Reasoning models like Qwen3-Instruct emit `<think>` blocks. For tool-using requests this means the model spends tokens reasoning instead of committing tool calls. The patch auto-disables `enable_thinking` when the request carries `tools`. Lets Qwen3-Coder + reasoning parser work as an agent. |
| **11 more Claude Code 2.x native tool stubs** | `ae25fb83` | (automatic) | Hand-tuned short stubs for tools like `EnterWorktree`, `CronCreate`, `TaskCreate` etc. that Claude Code ships in 2.1+. Without these the optimizer falls back to verbose schemas for those tools. |

Practical impact (M4 Max, `coder` profile, ~80K-token Claude Code request):

| Configuration | First-prefill |
|---|---|
| Vanilla `vllm-mlx serve` (no optimizer) | ~50s |
| With `--optimize-prompts --optimize-stub-tools` + `code` allowlist | ~3-5s |
| Same + warm-prompts | <1s |

This is why `localclaude` is mandatory if you want the local stack to feel like the cloud Claude. The fork patches are intended to land upstream; until they do, the local checkout is the way to get them.

See [vllm-mlx/docs/guides/optimizer.md](https://github.com/akaszubski/vllm-mlx/blob/main/docs/guides/optimizer.md) in the fork for the full optimizer reference.

## Performance tuning

`vllm-mlx` ships four cache / decode optimizations. Their default state in `localclaude` profiles:

| Knob | Flag | Default | What it buys you | Why this default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SSD cache tiering | `--ssd-cache-dir <path>` `--ssd-cache-max-gb <N>` | **on** — `$HOME/.localclaude/ssd-cache`, 20 GB cap | Persists prefix cache to disk; cold restarts reuse it (~3× speedup on repeat-call) | Briefly disabled (2026-04-27) after the writer thread was found to crash on bfloat16 KV (every production model) — see [`akaszubski/vllm-mlx#1`](https://github.com/akaszubski/vllm-mlx/issues/1). Fix landed in [`#2`](https://github.com/akaszubski/vllm-mlx/pull/2) (merged), so the default is back on. Disable with `LOCALCLAUDE_SSD_CACHE_DIR=off`. |
| Warm-prompts seeding | `--warm-prompts <seed.json>` | opt-in | Removes the 30s "first prompt" prefill stall via a pre-warmed cache | Seed file is project-specific; no sensible default |
| 8-bit KV quantization | `--kv-cache-quantization --kv-cache-quantization-bits 8` | opt-in | Halves KV memory pressure | **Bug**: incompatible with cache persistence ([waybarrios/vllm-mlx#443](https://github.com/waybarrios/vllm-mlx/issues/443)) — defeats SSD cache default if combined |
| MTP (speculative decoding) | `--enable-mtp` | opt-in, profile-gated | 2-3× decode speed on supported models | Only applies to Qwen3-Next / Qwen3.5/3.6; auto-disabled on other models |

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the reasoning behind each default.

### Override the default + enable opt-ins

```bash
# Disable the SSD cache (on by default since the bf16 fix in #2 merged — see table above):
LOCALCLAUDE_SSD_CACHE_DIR=off localclaude start coder

# Or bump the cap (default 20 GB):
LOCALCLAUDE_SSD_CACHE_MAX_GB=50 localclaude start coder

# Enable opt-in knobs via the bench escape hatch:
LOCALCLAUDE_EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS="--warm-prompts $(pwd)/bench/cases/seed.warm.json --enable-mtp" \
  localclaude start coder
```

### Benchmark before changing defaults

```bash
bench/run.sh                # full A/B/C/D/E matrix
bench/run.sh --smoke        # ~90s sanity
bench/run.sh --conditions C,D --cases 3,4 --trials 2   # focused diagnostic
```

See [`bench/README.md`](bench/README.md) for harness details and how to capture a fresh `seed.warm.json` for your project.

## Path overrides

`localclaude` resolves sister components from its own location. Override
individually if you've moved them:

```bash
LOCALCLAUDE_WORKSPACE_DIR=/path/to/workspace
LOCALCLAUDE_VLLM_MLX_DIR=/path/to/vllm-mlx
LOCALCLAUDE_SEARXNG_MCP_DIR=/path/to/searxng-mcp
```

## Diagnose

```bash
localclaude doctor   # full stack health check
localclaude test     # end-to-end smoke (real model query + decoder-collapse detection)
localclaude status   # what's running + connect command + recent log lines
```

## State on disk

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `~/.localclaude/.active` | Last-used profile config (read by `restart` / `cc` / `status`) |
| `~/.localclaude/logs/<profile>.log` | Per-profile server logs |
| `~/.localclaude/ssd-cache/` | persistent KV cache pages (default 20 GB cap; `LOCALCLAUDE_SSD_CACHE_DIR=off` to disable) |
| `~/Models/` | Model weights — canonical (set `HF_HUB_CACHE=$HOME/Models`) |
| `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/` | Model weights — legacy fallback (`localclaude` reads both) |
